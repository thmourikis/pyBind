## Motivation

The application was created in order to overcome the limitations that users have when run the online version NetMHCpan-3. For example, users can explore maximum 20 HLA alleles per submission in the online version of NetMHCpan-3. At the same time, downloading source code and running it via the command line is not always feasible.

Also, pyBind allows the extension of the analysis using additional binding predictions algorithms.

## Installation

pyBind repository includes a compiled version of the software for Mac. Downloading this repository and double-clicking on the pyBind executable should be enough to run it in Mac. We are working towards compiling pyBind for additional platforms.
