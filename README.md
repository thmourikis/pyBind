## Synopsis

pyBind is a Qt/python application that runs NetMHCpan-3.0 algorithm locally.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

The application was created in order to overcome the limitations that users have by running NetMHCpan-3 via its web interface. For example, users can explore maximum 20 HLA alleles per submission in the online version of NetMHCpan-3. At the same time, downloading source code and running it via the command line is not always feasible for labs without bioinformaticians.

Also, pyBind allows the extension of the analysis using additional binding predictions algorithms.

## Installation

pyBind repository includes a compiled version of the software for Mac. Downloading this repository and double-clicking on the pyBind executable should be enough to run it in Mac. We are working towards compiling pyBind for additional platforms.
